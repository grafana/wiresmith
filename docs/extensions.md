# Custom proto extensions

wiresmith exposes a single custom `.proto` file with field-level options that influence the generated Go shape without changing the wire format. The on-wire layout always matches stock proto3 — switching the option on or off does not break binary compatibility with peers using other libraries.

## `wiresmith/options.proto`

The file lives in the repo at [`compiler/generator/embed/wiresmith/options.proto`](../compiler/generator/embed/wiresmith/options.proto) and is embedded into the compiler binary. The CLI serves it from the canonical import path `wiresmith/options.proto`, so user proto trees can import it without vendoring:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package myapp.v1;

import "wiresmith/options.proto";

message Foo {
  // ...
}
```

The lookup is keyed on the import path, so a user file that happens to declare the same proto package (`wiresmith.options`) cannot shadow the embedded definition. See [`compiler/generator/option_pointer.go`](../compiler/generator/option_pointer.go) for the resolution and validation pass.

## `(wiresmith.options.pointer) = true`

The pointer option opts a field into protoc-gen-go / gogoproto-style pointer codegen.

| Field shape on the proto         | Default Go type | With `(wiresmith.options.pointer) = true` |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Singular `message Foo`           | `Foo`           | `*Foo`                                    |
| Repeated `message Foo`           | `[]Foo`         | `[]*Foo`                                  |

For the pointer-shaped form, `nil` means absent: no tag is emitted on marshal, and a `nil` element in a repeated slice is silently skipped.

### Where it applies

Allowed: singular or repeated message fields.

Rejected (and reported as a single combined compile-time error from `validatePointerOptions`):

- Scalars, enums, `bytes`, and `string` — the option only makes sense for message fields. Error: `(wiresmith.options.pointer) only applies to message fields, got <kind>`.
- Map fields. Error: `(wiresmith.options.pointer) is not supported on map fields`.
- Oneof variants — they are already interface-boxed. Error: `(wiresmith.options.pointer) is not supported on oneof variants — variants are already interface-boxed`.
- Fields declared with the proto3 `optional` keyword — `optional` already produces a pointer. Error: `(wiresmith.options.pointer) cannot combine with 'optional' — 'optional' already produces a pointer`.

The validation source of truth is `pointerOptionRejection` in `compiler/generator/option_pointer.go`.

### Worked example

[`proto/basic/pointer.proto`](../proto/basic/pointer.proto) exercises all three positions side by side and serves as the integration test fixture:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package basic.pointer.v1;
option go_package = "github.com/grafana/wiresmith/gen/basic/pointer/v1";

import "wiresmith/options.proto";

message Leaf {
  int64  id   = 1;
  string name = 2;
}

message PointerHolder {
  string name = 1;

  // Generated Go: head *Leaf
  Leaf head = 2 [(wiresmith.options.pointer) = true];

  // Generated Go: items []*Leaf
  repeated Leaf items = 3 [(wiresmith.options.pointer) = true];

  // Control: default value-type shape, generated Go: tail Leaf
  Leaf tail = 4;
}
```

The option is local to a field; mixing pointer and value shapes within the same message is supported and exercised by this fixture.

## `(wiresmith.options.jsontag) = "..."`

The jsontag option overrides the `json:"..."` value of the generated Go struct tag. The wire format is unaffected; the option only changes the JSON-side contract a caller sees through `encoding/json`. Use it when the proto field name diverges from an existing JSON schema you have to honor (e.g. `block_id` on the wire vs. `blockID` in an HTTP API).

```proto
message BlockMeta {
  string block_id      = 1 [(wiresmith.options.jsontag) = "blockID"];
  uint64 total_objects = 2 [(wiresmith.options.jsontag) = "totalObjects,omitempty"];
}
```

```go
type BlockMeta struct {
    BlockId      string `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,..." json:"blockID"`
    TotalObjects uint64 `protobuf:"varint,2,opt,..." json:"totalObjects,omitempty"`
}
```

The supplied value is used **verbatim** — `,omitempty` is not appended for you, matching `gogoproto.jsontag` semantics. To opt a field out of JSON serialization, use `"-"` (which produces `json:"-"`, the `encoding/json` opt-out idiom); an empty string would emit `json:""`, which `encoding/json` treats as "no tag given" and is *not* an opt-out.

### Where it applies

Allowed on every field kind: scalar, message, repeated, map, and oneof variant.

Rejected (reported as a single combined compile-time error from `validateJsontagOptions`):

- Values containing a backtick. Error: `(wiresmith.options.jsontag) must not contain backticks (would terminate the struct tag)`. Quotes inside the value are safe because tag emission escapes them through `%q`.

The validation source of truth is `validateJsontagOptions` in `compiler/generator/option_jsontag.go`.

### Worked example

[`proto/basic/jsontag.proto`](../proto/basic/jsontag.proto) exercises the option across scalar, message, repeated, map, and the `"-"` opt-out, with an unannotated field as the control showing the default `json:"<proto_name>,omitempty"` shape is unaffected.

## `(wiresmith.options.customtype) = "import/path.TypeName"`

The customtype option replaces the generated Go field type with a user-supplied type that owns its wire encoding. The on-wire layout is unchanged — the field still occupies the same number and is encoded length-delimited; only the Go-side representation differs.

```proto
message LabelSet {
  bytes  pairs     = 1 [(wiresmith.options.customtype) = "github.com/myorg/pkg.LabelPairs"];
  string tenant_id = 2 [(wiresmith.options.customtype) = "github.com/myorg/pkg.TenantID"];
}
```

```go
type LabelSet struct {
    Pairs    pkg.LabelPairs `protobuf:"..."`
    TenantId pkg.TenantID   `protobuf:"..."`
}
```

The import is registered automatically — users don't need to vendor anything beyond their own type. The value accepts two shapes:

- `"import/path.TypeName"` — fully qualified; the generator pulls in the import with an explicit alias derived from the path's base name (`bar` for `github.com/foo/bar`) and qualifies the type via that alias (`bar.TypeName`). The path base must be a valid Go identifier; it does *not* need to match the imported package's `package` declaration, so module major-version layouts (`.../foo/v2`) and packages whose directory name differs from their declared name are both supported. If two customtype paths share the same base name (or the base collides with another import in the same file), the second alias gets a numeric suffix (`bar1`, `bar2`, …) so the generated file always compiles.
- `"TypeName"` — same-package shorthand for types defined in the same Go package as the generated file (no import is emitted).

### The CustomMarshaler interface

The user-supplied type must implement the wiresmith reverse-write shape:

```go
type CustomMarshaler interface {
    SizeWiresmith() int
    MarshalWiresmith(buf []byte) (int, error)
    UnmarshalWiresmith(buf []byte) error
    EqualWiresmith(other any) bool
    CompareWiresmith(other any) int    // -1/0/+1 like bytes.Compare
}
```

- `SizeWiresmith()` returns the encoded payload length (the wrapper supplies the tag + varint length around it). The generator skips the field entirely when this returns `0`, matching proto3 omit-default semantics on plain bytes/string.
- `MarshalWiresmith(buf)` writes forward into `buf`, which is sized to exactly `SizeWiresmith()` bytes by the generator before the call. Reverse-write happens at the proto-envelope level; the customtype only sees a contiguous slice.
- `UnmarshalWiresmith(buf)` is invoked with the exact payload bytes the decoder sliced out of the wire input. Pointer-receiver implementations are required for fields backed by struct types; value-aliased primitive types (e.g. `type T string`) can use the same shape via `*T`.
- `EqualWiresmith(other any)` is consulted from the generated `Equal()` method. Implementations type-assert and return `false` on mismatch.
- `CompareWiresmith(other any) int` is consulted from the generated `Compare()` method (added by #100). Returns -1/0/+1 like `bytes.Compare` / `strings.Compare`. Implementations type-assert and return a sentinel (commonly `-1`) on type mismatch so the wrapper's Compare stays total.

The interface deliberately uses wiresmith-specific method names so a caller can't accidentally satisfy it with gogoproto's `Marshal()` / `Unmarshal()` shape — those have incompatible signatures.

### Where it applies (v1)

Allowed: singular `bytes` and `string` fields.

Rejected (combined compile-time error from `validateCustomtypeOptions`):

- Non-bytes/non-string scalars, enums, and message fields.
- Map fields, oneof variants, repeated fields, and proto3 `optional` fields.
- Malformed values: empty string, leading-digit type name, embedded whitespace, etc.

Customtype-on-message is fundamentally different plumbing (the user type owns the entire submessage wire encoding) and is out of scope for v1.

### Worked example

[`proto/basic/customtype.proto`](../proto/basic/customtype.proto) annotates a bytes and a string field with customtypes defined in [`test/customtypes/customtypes.go`](../test/customtypes/customtypes.go), with unannotated controls of each kind to demonstrate the swap is local to the annotated field.

## `(wiresmith.options.customname) = "Identifier"`

The customname option overrides the Go identifier the generator picks for the field. By default the proto field `block_id` becomes `BlockId` (initialism mangled); with customname it can be `BlockID` (or any other valid exported Go identifier).

```proto
message BlockMeta {
  string block_id = 1 [(wiresmith.options.customname) = "BlockID"];
}
```

```go
type BlockMeta struct {
    BlockID string `protobuf:"..." json:"block_id,omitempty"`
}

func (m *BlockMeta) GetBlockID() string { ... }
func (m *BlockMeta) HasBlockID() bool   { ... }
```

The rename reaches every consumer the generator emits: struct field declaration, `Get<Name>()` and `Has<Name>()` accessors, marshal/unmarshal access expressions, `Equal()` comparisons, and the field inside a oneof variant's wrapper struct. The wire format is unchanged.

### Scope of the rename

- **Renamed:** the struct field, every `Get*` / `Has*` accessor, and (for oneof variants) the wrapper-struct field.
- **NOT renamed:** the oneof variant wrapper *type* (e.g. `Foo_BlockId` stays anchored to the proto field name even when the variant carries `(wiresmith.options.customname) = "BlockID"`). The wrapper type is the schema-visible Go identity; the user-facing API is the accessor methods, which do follow the override.

### Validation

Values must be valid **exported** Go identifiers — the first character must be an uppercase letter and the rest must be letters, digits, or underscores. A lowercase-first or punctuation-bearing value is rejected at codegen time with a clear diagnostic.

The validation source of truth is `customnameOptionRejection` in `compiler/generator/option_customname.go`.

### Worked example

[`proto/basic/customname.proto`](../proto/basic/customname.proto) exercises the option across scalar, message, repeated, and oneof-variant fields, with an unannotated control showing that default `snake_to_PascalCase` conversion still applies elsewhere.
